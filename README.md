Hello World!

The following Javascript code was created by me to use for a Password Generator assignment in class.
You will notice that the notes explicitly list every part of the function to help myself and anyone viewing my code a better understanding of whats going on within the functions.

The Goal was to create a code that took user validated inputs to generate a password based on there selections.
